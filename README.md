## Clinical-Outcomes-and-Patient-Satisfaction-Analysis-in-Telehealth-Services

Project Overview and Problem Definition:
A healthcare organization has implemented a telehealth program to provide remote medical consultations to its patients. However, the organization needs to assess the program's effectiveness in terms of clinical outcomes and 
patient satisfaction compared to traditional in person care. They want to determine whether telehealth services are achieving equivalent or better results and whether patients are satisfied with the remote care experience.

### Project Goals:
The primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the telehealth program's impact on clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. This involves comparing various healthcare metrics between telehealth and 
in-person care, identifying trends, and understanding patient preferences and perceptions.
